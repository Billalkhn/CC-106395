## Java Compiler and Interpreter ? ##

Java can be considered as both compiler and interpreter. Thatâ€™s because compiler first converts the code into intermediate language which is known as byte code file then interpreter of java converts the byte code into specific machine language.Furthermore, code written in java is first compiled into binary byte code which then runs on the JVM which is known as java virtual machine which acts as a software based interpreter. The advantage of running that binary byte code into JVM interpreter is it allows it to be fast, small and efficient. Although the code running on Java is little slower as compared to C++ because of JVM interpreter but it provides more security features.
