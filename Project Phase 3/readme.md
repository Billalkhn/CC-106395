## Project Description ##

The main aim of this project was to understand the importance of compiler. Being a computer science student it is important to how to use a compiler and what is going on inside the tool that we are using. It enables us to design and implement our own domain-specific language. The compiler design allows use of formal methods that are rarely seen anywhere. The analysis of compilers is a good way to get started with formal methods. So by studying compiler we can learn alot of things. And that's the aim of our project also we learned how to use a subset of large language, its specifications and CFG. Also learned how with the help of lexicial specifications we can make a lexical analyzer and design a parser.
